# Readme for history of anthropology timeline
Alex Golub, UH Mānoa
7 December 2016

This project grew organically over time. It is meant to be part of a larger research project on the history of anthropology in the UK, USA, and France from 1927 to 2027. It is designed to be viewed in Aeon Timeline. The earliest date is the bith of Lewis Henry Morgan on 21 Nov 1818 and the latest is the death of Roy D'Andrade on 20 Oct 2016. It has just over 1,000 entries. There are probably some duplicates here and there (especially in publications) that I didn't catch, tho. The timeline was designed to be used with the program Aeon Timeline.

The timeline has two arcs: publications (books, articles, etc.) and institutions (everything that isn't a publication). The entities in the timeline are individual anthropologists. In general, for roughly 118 anthropologists. Every event in associated with a person (ideally)! In the beginning of making this database I was cavalier in citation, but now am much more strict. The notes field of each event should include a cite to the source for each date. For publications, this is ideally copyright.gov but for most publications is it is just from the UHM library catalog or other people's claims about when books were published.

All events are color-coded based on where they happened (for publications, this is the main office of the publishing house). A list of colors can be found below.

Tags are associated with each event. A list of tags can be found below. Importantly, I've attempted to tag all events that happened at institutions. This way filtering by tag can reveal a rough history of the departments and universities in question.

I am sure your favorite person is not on here.

## Things you can sort for if I do this right, and other notes on usage
- I guess technically every entry with a department tag should also have a department tag.
- When all departments were founded: search tags department + founded

## Colors
I try as much as possible to make these reflect WHERE the events actually happened, not what the 'alleigance' of the person eventing is (whatever that would mean)
red - America, Canada
blue - France
yellow - UK, Australia, New Zealand
purple - Europe
Orange - Africa
Green - latin America
light green - Asia (yes, I know this is a bit broad!)
